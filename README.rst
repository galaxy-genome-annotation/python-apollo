Apollo is a Python library for interacting with
`Apollo <https://github.com/gmod/apollo/>`__. Arrow is its companion CLI tool.

    `for the record <https://gitter.im/galaxy-genome-annotation/Lobby?at=5ebee6c049a1b7318479380d>`__ ... arrow makes working with Apollo SOOO much easier
    â€” Nathan Dunn, Apollo Developer


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install apollo

Examples
--------

Example code to create a new organism and add yourself in the permission list:

.. code:: python

    from apollo import ApolloInstance
    wa = ApolloInstance('https://fqdn/apollo', 'jane.doe@fqdn.edu', 'password')

    orgs = wa.organisms.add_organism(
        "Yeast",
        "/path/to/jbrowse/data",
        genus='Saccharomyces',
        species='cerevisiae',
        public=False
    )

    # Give Apollo a second to process the uploaded organism.
    time.sleep(1)

    # Then add yourself to permission list
    data = wa.users.update_organism_permissions(
        "jane.doe@fqdn.edu",
        "Yeast",
        write=True,
        export=True,
        read=True,
    )

If you have already created an Arrow config file (with command `arrow init`),
you can also get an ApolloInstance without writing credentials explicitely:

.. code:: python

    from arrow.apollo import get_apollo_instance
    wa = get_apollo_instance()

Or with the Arrow client:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ arrow groups create_group university
    {
        "publicGroup": false,
        "class": "org.bbop.apollo.UserGroup",
        "name": "university",
        "users": null,
        "id": 558319
    }
    # THEN
    $ arrow users get_users | \
        jq '.[] | select(.username | contains("@tamu.edu")) | .username' | \
        xargs -n1 arrow users add_to_group university
    # OR
    $ arrow users get_users | \
        jq '.[] | select(.username | contains("@tamu.edu")) | .username' | \
        paste -s -d',' | \
        xargs arrow group update_membership 558319 --users
